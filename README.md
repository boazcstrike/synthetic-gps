# Synthetic GPS for Xcode

Exploitation: Since the location simulation of Xcode takes effect on a live app on the phone, setting pinned locations in the gpx can trick the whole phone into going to different places. This can be done while building and running the App through Xcode and through an iPhone.

#### Connect to your phone.
#### Build Xcode.
#### Set/Edit Live GPX locations.
#### Open Developer App. (Maintain this app running)
#### Open Pokemon Go.
#### Edit Live GPX locations to move.
